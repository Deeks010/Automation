**QUOTES**

- "Can we use these kind of agents for to solve Healthcare problems like diagnosis treatment recommendations so on and so forth probably I'm against of it as of now but yeah in future that will definitely happen."
- "This video is for someone who wants to explore the possibilities and then see how they can combine their own human uh experiences in this technology to build something tangible and feasible."
- "So let's jump in and see what I'm going to do here."
- "Based on the patient symptoms of cold and cuff the possible conditions to consider the common cold flu allergies asthma bronchitis and postnasal drip."
- "It is important for the patient to consult with a healthcare professional for an accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment plan."
- "I'm going to say uh migraine and uh Dess or something uh migraine and weight loss."
- "It first symptoms of migraine weight loss it goes on internet and gives you all the relevant thing."
- "The diagnostician agent has an observation it finishes the chain and then it passes to the next beton which is the next agent which is the uh treatment one."
- "According to the preliminary diagnosis of migraines with weight loss the following treatment recommendations can be considered migraine treatment acute medications."
- "Using AI agents to make diagnosis diagnosis or do diagnostic reports and stuff still not there okay you need you need a lot of uh you need hell lot of context and better instructions to kind of build these kind of systems."
